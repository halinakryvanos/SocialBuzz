 This task is essential because it is one of the specific requirements that the client has asked for, so we are relying on the data analyst to work with the data and create accurate, reliable insights that can be backed up during the final presentation.  
 The next step will be bringing the data set to life. A large component of being a data analyst, includes the ability to find relevant insights and ensure that they are clearly communicated to the business and client. These insights should be synthesized and placed in a presentation for the client that is engaging and easily understood.
